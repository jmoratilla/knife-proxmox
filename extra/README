HOW-TO FIX PROXMOX TO GET AN IP ADDRESS FROM A RECENTLY CREATED OPENVZ

Patch the original file with this modification (only valid for Proxmox VE 2.2 version):

$ pvesh get version
200 OK
{
   "release" : "26",
   "repoid" : "c1614c8c",
   "version" : "2.2"
}

Apply the patch with:

cd /usr/share/perl5/PVE
sudo patch < OpenVZ.patch

Finally, you'll need to restart your proxmox server to apply the changes.
