HOW-TO FIX PROXMOX TO GET AN IP ADDRESS FROM A RECENTLY CREATED OPENVZ


Abstract:

This patch allows you to get the ipaddress assigned to a container
when it is configure with DHCP.


Warning:

Patch the original file with this modification (only valid for Proxmox 
VE 2.2 version and newer):

$ pvesh get version
200 OK
{
   "release" : "26",
   "repoid" : "c1614c8c",
   "version" : "2.2"
}



Instructions:

Go to the subdirectory of the Proxmox VE you are trying to Patch.  Copy
OpenVZ.patch to your target server and then, apply the patch with:

cd /usr/share/perl5/PVE
sudo patch < /path/to/OpenVZ.patch

Finally, you'll need to restart your proxmox server to apply the changes.

NOTE HERE:

Everytime the server is upgraded, you must apply the patch in order to 
keep this feature working.
